### 7. **Optional: Publishing**

Do you want to:
- ✅ Publish `smart-common` to GitHub Packages or Maven Central?
- 🚫 Or just import it locally for now?

Let me know and I’ll help set up `publish.yml` workflow too.

### ✅ Once You Push
Let me know once:
- Repo is created
- Code is pushed
- You want to publish it or use it as a local Gradle project in `smart-content`

I'll guide you through the next integration step.
